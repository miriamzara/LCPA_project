    "\n",
    "The advancement in DNA sequencing tecniques have enabled access to fine-detailed information about the composition of gut microbiota. There is a widespread interest in the scientific comunity around the goal of modeling and predicting the dynamics of these ecological communities, with the aim of producing innovative terapeutic interventions.  However, althogh a wide variety of methods have been published in recent years, many of these are unprincipled and lack reliable validation methods.  Some studies suggest that gut microbiomes cluster into distinct groups (enterotypes), while others argue that these patterns may arise as artifacts of statistical analysis rather than biological reality. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In our project, following the article *\"A macroecological description of alternative stable states reproduces intra- and inter-host variability of gut microbiome\", Silvia Zaoli and Jacopo Grilli*, we analyze experimental data of mice gut microbiota assuming a simple stochastic logistic model. This model, specifically, assumes that each bacterial species evolves independently from the others, thus it can be used as a simple, essential null-model to investigate if inter-species interactions can be at all inferred from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic model predicts that, after a transient, the species abundances will eventually settle down to a steady state, parametrized by two parametes: the carrying capacity, accounting for the global effect of the environment, and a parameter $\\sigma$ quantifying the stochastic noise. We will follow the methods described in the article, which use a properly defined dissimilarity measure to assess stationarity, designed to overcome the scarsity of data samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "This main task will require preliminary data processing and basic statistic analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "!!!!   WE HAVEN'T DONE THIS YET !!!!\n",
    "Optionally, in the case where the null model doesn't suffice to explain the data, we will try to infer the interaction matrix of species-species interaction assuming a simple stochastic Lockta Volterra model, and using linear regression with k-fold validation."
